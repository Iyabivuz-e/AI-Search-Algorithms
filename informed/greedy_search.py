#  What is Greedy Best-First Search?
    # Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) is a pathfinding algorithm.
    # It always chooses the path that looks closest to the goal (like a magnet pulling you towards the goal).
    # It doesnâ€™t care how long the path is, only how close it thinks it is to the goal.
    
import heapq # To make sure that our frontier is always sorted and gives us the least value.

    visited = set() # An object to keep tracking of visited nodes so that we dont repeat the node twice
