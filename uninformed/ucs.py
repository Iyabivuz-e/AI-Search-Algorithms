# Why UCS is Cool üòé:
    # Always guarantees the best path.
    # Never wastes time on more expensive paths.
    # Ideal for finding optimal solutions when costs differ.
# Why Use UCS in AI?
    # UCS is perfect for robot navigation, path planning, and game AI.
    # For example:
    # A robot finding the shortest path in a maze. ü§ñ
    # A GPS finding the fastest route to a destination. üó∫Ô∏è
# How It Works (Simple Steps):
    # Start at the beginning (where you are right now).
    # Look at all possible paths you can take from your current spot.
    # Always choose the path with the lowest cost first.
    # Keep doing this until you reach the goal (candy store).

def uniform_cost_search(graph, start, target):
    frontier = [(0, start, [])] # To keep track of the cost, current_node, and the paths we have visited so far.
                                # frontier = [ (cost, current_node, [])] e.x: frontier = [(0, 'A', [])] if start is 'A'
    visited = set()
    
    while frontier:
        frontier.sort(key = lambda x: x[0]) # This will sort the frontier to get the lowest cost
        cost, node, path = frontier.pop(0) # We remove the path with the lowest cost
        
        if node == target:
            return path, cost # This means that we have found the target (reached the goal)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            
            for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    total_cost = cost + edge_cost
                    frontier.append((total_cost, neighbor, path + [node]))
    return "No path found"
