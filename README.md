Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of search algorithms, including classic pathfinding techniques and optimization strategies. Each algorithm is implemented with clean, well-documented code to facilitate understanding and ease of use.

Algorithms Included:

**Uninformed Search Algorithms**

    . Breadth-First Search (BFS)

    . Depth-First Search (DFS)

    . Uniform Cost Search

**Informed Search Algorithms**

    . A* (A-star) Algorithm

    . Greedy Best-First Search

**Optimization Algorithms**

    . Hill Climbing

    . Simulated Annealing

    . Genetic Algorithms
